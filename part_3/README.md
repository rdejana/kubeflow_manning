Created new ARM based docker/containerfile with a more updated set of libraries (e.g. TF 2.0 as 1.x)  

Containerfile -> "Dockerfile" used to build base image.
buildAndRunTFContainer.md -> commands and output for and from running the tf_hello container in docker (podman).
component.yaml -> yaml file that defines the custom image based component used in the pipeline.
hello_pipeline.tar.gz -> pipeline def
pipelineRun.png -> screenshot of the pipeline run.
